# AddressBook
The Address Book application implemented in the console.
In my book, you can:  
âž¡ Add a contact with the following parameters: first name, last name, phone number, email;  
âž¡ View the current list of accumulated contacts;  
âž¡ Find the person you need by name or phone number, and it is not necessary to know them completely;  
âž¡ Delete an outdated or irrelevant contact using a conveniently implemented function;  
âž¡ You can call the instructions at any time if you forgot something.

Naturally, the program provides error handling and maximum work has been done to facilitate use so that the user has only a good impressionðŸ˜„.  

The address book data is stored in a separate file with a copy, which ensures greater safety. Access to the file is implemented using the Pickle module.  

And of the pleasant little things, I will add that my program will always say hello to you and highlight the main elements of the interface - in color, so that you don't forget anything for sure and can easily get the necessary information.  

Have a nice dayðŸ˜‹
